## About

[Mermaid Chart](https://www.mermaidchart.com) was born out of the Mermaid open source project and was founded by Knut Sveidqvist together with Open Core Ventures. The lead developers from Mermaid have joined the company and there is a strong connection between the project we all love and Mermaid Chart. Mermaid Chart brings resources to the open source development of Mermaid and makes it possible to work with Mermaid professionally.
