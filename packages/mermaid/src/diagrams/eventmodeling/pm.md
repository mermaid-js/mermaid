# Event Modeling project management

## in progress

## todo

- [ ] write basic docs
- [ ] coverage tests
- [ ] render swimlanes for namespaced entities
- [ ] render GWTs
- [ ] render Notes
- [ ] render diagram title and common attributes
- [ ] output Draw.io SVG+XML
- [ ] output Martin's Miro JSON (in SVG?)
- [ ] render nicer relations
- [ ] move decide/evolve to `db.ts`?
- [ ] support slice identification in the language?
- [ ] identify slice type (state view, state change, translation, automation)?
- [ ] either remove Box.y or calculate it properly and use it in rendering time instead of relying on Swimlane.y calculation

## done

- [x] dynamic swimlane position and size
- [x] multiple source frames rendering
- [x] flexible box rendering
- [x] nice colours
- [x] basic layout with dynamic positioning (not in static grid)
