# Pie chart diagrams

> A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801

Mermaid can render Pie Chart diagrams.

```mermaid-example
pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 85
    "Rats" : 15
```

```mermaid
pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 85
    "Rats" : 15
```

## Syntax

Drawing a pie chart is really simple in mermaid.

- Start with `pie` keyword to begin the diagram
  - `showData` to render the actual data values after the legend text. This is **_OPTIONAL_**
- Followed by `title` keyword and its value in string to give a title to the pie-chart. This is **_OPTIONAL_**
- Followed by dataSet. Pie slices will be ordered clockwise in the same order as the labels.
  - `label` for a section in the pie diagram within `" "` quotes.
  - Followed by `:` colon as separator
  - Followed by `positive numeric value` (supported up to two decimal places)

\[pie] \[showData] (OPTIONAL)
\[title] \[titlevalue] (OPTIONAL)
"\[datakey1]" : \[dataValue1]
"\[datakey2]" : \[dataValue2]
"\[datakey3]" : \[dataValue3]
.
.

## Example

```mermaid-example
---
config:
  pie:
    textPosition: 0.5
  themeVariables:
    pieOuterStrokeWidth: "5px"
---
pie showData
    title Key elements in Product X
    "Calcium" : 42.96
    "Potassium" : 50.05
    "Magnesium" : 10.01
    "Iron" :  5
```

```mermaid
---
config:
  pie:
    textPosition: 0.5
  themeVariables:
    pieOuterStrokeWidth: "5px"

pie showData
    title Key elements in Product X
    "Calcium" : 42.96
    "Potassium" : 50.05

    "Iron" :  5
```

## Configuration

Possible pie diagram configuration parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                  | Default value |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `textPosition` | The axial position of the pie slice labels, from 0.0 at the center to 1.0 at the outside edge of the circle. | `0.75`        |
