# Ishikawa Diagram

> **Note**: Ishikawa diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams.

An Ishikawa diagram is a tool for identifying the root causes of a problem. It helps teams systematically analyze complex issues by organizing potential causes into categories, creating a visual representation that resembles a fishbone.

## What is an Ishikawa Diagram?

An Ishikawa diagram (also known as a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram) is a tool for identifying the root causes of a problem. It helps teams systematically analyze complex issues by organizing potential causes into categories.

The diagram gets its name from its creator, Kaoru Ishikawa, and its appearance - the main problem is written at the "head" of the fish, and the causes branch out like the bones of a fish skeleton.

## Common Categories

### The 8 Ps (Service Industries)

- **Product/Service**: Issues related to the product or service itself
- **Price**: Cost-related problems
- **Place**: Location or distribution issues
- **Promotion**: Marketing and communication problems
- **People**: Human resource and training issues
- **Process**: Workflow and procedure problems
- **Physical Evidence**: Tangible aspects of the service
- **Performance**: Quality and efficiency issues

### The 6 Ms (Manufacturing)

- **Materials**: Raw materials, supplies, and components
- **Methods**: Procedures, processes, and work instructions
- **Machines**: Equipment, tools, and technology
- **Environment**: Physical conditions and surroundings
- **Measurement**: Inspection, testing, and quality control
- **Manpower**: People, skills, and training

## Basic Syntax

The syntax for creating Ishikawa diagrams is simple and relies on indentation for setting the levels in the hierarchy.

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Customer complaints increasing"
category "People"
  "Lack of training"
  "Poor communication"
  "Inadequate supervision"
category "Process"
  "Inefficient workflow"
  "Missing procedures"
  "Poor documentation"
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Customer complaints increasing"
category "People"
  "Lack of training"
  "Poor communication"
  "Inadequate supervision"
category "Process"
  "Inefficient workflow"
  "Missing procedures"
  "Poor documentation"
```

## Syntax Elements

### Problem Statement

Start your diagram with the `problem` keyword followed by the main issue:

```
problem "Your problem statement here"
```

### Categories

Define categories using the `category` keyword:

```
category "Category name"
```

### Causes

List causes under each category using indentation:

```
category "People"
  "Cause 1"
  "Cause 2"
  "Cause 3"
```

## Different Shapes

Like other Mermaid diagrams, you can use different shapes for your nodes:

### Square

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  [Poor quality raw materials]
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  [Poor quality raw materials]
```

### Rounded Square

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  (Poor quality raw materials)
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  (Poor quality raw materials)
```

### Circle

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  ((Poor quality raw materials))
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  ((Poor quality raw materials))
```

### Cloud

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  )Poor quality raw materials(
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  )Poor quality raw materials(
```

### Hexagon

```mermaid-example
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  {{Poor quality raw materials}}
```

```mermaid
ishikawa
problem "Quality issues"
category "Materials"
  {{Poor quality raw materials}}
```

## Examples

### Manufacturing Quality Issues

```mermaid-example
ishikawa

category "Materials"
  "Poor quality raw materials"
  "Inconsistent suppliers"
  "Storage problems"
category "Methods"
  "Outdated procedures"
  "Lack of standardization"
  "Poor work instructions"
category "Machines"
  "Equipment breakdowns"
  "Inadequate maintenance"
  "Calibration issues"
category "Environment"
  "Temperature fluctuations"
  "Humidity issues"
  "Poor lighting"
```

```mermaid

### Service Delivery Problems

```mermaid-example

category "People"
  [Staff shortages]
  (Poor training)
  ((High turnover))
category "Process"
  [Complex procedures]
  (Inefficient workflow)
  ((Lack of automation))
category "Physical Evidence"
  [Poor facilities]
  (Outdated equipment)
  ((Inadequate signage))
```

category "People"
  [Staff shortages]
  (Poor training)

### Software Development Issues

```mermaid-example

  "Missing deployment checks"
  "Poor change management"
category "Technology"
  "Outdated frameworks"
  "Integration issues"
  "Performance bottlenecks"
category "Environment"
  "Different dev/prod environments"
  "Configuration drift"
  "Resource constraints"
```

```mermaid
ishikawa

category "People"
  "Lack of testing experience"
  "Poor code reviews"

  "Poor change management"
category "Technology"
  "Outdated frameworks"
  "Integration issues"
  "Performance bottlenecks"
category "Environment"
  "Different dev/prod environments"
  "Configuration drift"
  "Resource constraints"
```

## Configuration

You can configure the appearance of Ishikawa diagrams using the `ishikawa` configuration object:

```javascript
mermaid.initialize({
  ishikawa: {
    padding: 20, // Padding around nodes
    maxNodeWidth: 200, // Maximum width of nodes
    useMaxWidth: true, // Use maximum width for the diagram
    fontSize: 14, // Font size for text
    fontFamily: 'Arial', // Font family
    fontWeight: 'normal', // Font weight
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a clear problem statement**: Be specific about what issue you're analyzing
2. **Use appropriate categories**: Choose categories that make sense for your industry and problem
3. **Be specific with causes**: Avoid vague statements; be as specific as possible
4. **Use the 5 Whys technique**: Ask "why" multiple times to get to root causes
5. **Involve the right people**: Include team members who are closest to the problem
6. **Validate causes**: Ensure that the identified causes are actually contributing to the problem

## Use Cases

Ishikawa diagrams are particularly useful for:

- **Quality management**: Identifying causes of defects or quality issues
- **Process improvement**: Understanding bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Problem solving**: Systematic analysis of complex problems
- **Team collaboration**: Visual tool for group discussions
- **Training**: Teaching systematic problem-solving approaches
- **Documentation**: Recording analysis for future reference

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate the diagram with too many categories or causes
2. **Focus on facts**: Base your analysis on data and observations, not assumptions
3. **Prioritize causes**: Not all causes are equally important; identify the most significant ones
4. **Update regularly**: Revisit and update the diagram as you learn more about the problem
5. **Use it as a starting point**: The diagram should lead to action plans, not just analysis
