## ðŸš€ Mermaid Chart's Visual Editor for Flowcharts

The Mermaid Chart team is excited to introduce a new Visual Editor for flowcharts, enabling users of all skill levels to create diagrams easily and efficiently, with both GUI and code-based editing options.

Create flowchart nodes, connect them with edges, update shapes, change colors, and edit labels with just a few clicks that automatically reflect in your diagramâ€™s code for easy customizability.
