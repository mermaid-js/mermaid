# 🛠️ How to Create a New Layout Algorithm in Mermaid

Mermaid supports pluggable layout engines, and contributors can add custom layout algorithms to support specialized rendering needs such as clustered layouts, nested structures, or domain-specific visualizations.

This guide outlines the steps required to **create and integrate a new layout algorithm** into the Mermaid codebase.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- You have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Integration

### Refer [Mermaid Contributing Guide](../community/contributing.md)

---

## 🧠 Implementing Your Custom Layout Algorithm

### 1. Create Your Layout Folder

Navigate to the relevant source directory and create a folder for your new algorithm:

```bash
cd packages/mermaid/src/layout
mkdir myCustomLayout
touch myCustomLayout/index.ts
```

> 📁 You can organize supporting files, utils, and types inside this folder.

### 2. Register the Layout Algorithm

Open the file:

```
packages/mermaid/src/rendering-util/render.ts
```

Inside the function `registerDefaultLayoutLoaders`, find the `layoutLoaders` array. Add your layout here:

```ts
registerDefaultLayoutLoaders([
  ...,
  {
    id: 'myCustomLayout',
    loader: () => import('../layout/myCustomLayout'),
  },
]);
```

This tells Mermaid how to load your layout dynamically by name (`id`).

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Algorithm

### 3. Create a Test File

To visually test your layout implementation, create a test HTML file in:

```
cypress/platform/
```

Example:

```bash
touch cypress/platform/myCustomLayoutTest.html
```

Inside the file, load your diagram like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import mermaid from '/dist/mermaid.esm.mjs';

      mermaid.initialize({
        startOnLoad: true,
        theme: 'default',
        layout: 'myCustomLayout', // Use your layout here
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="mermaid">graph TD A[Node A] --> B[Node B] B --> C[Node C]</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4. Open in Browser

After running `pnpm dev`, open your test in the browser:

```
http://localhost:9000/myCustomLayoutTest.html
```

You should see your diagram rendered using your new layout engine.

---

## 📝 Tips

- Keep your layout algorithm modular and readable.
- Use TypeScript types and helper functions for better structure.
- Add comments and constraints where necessary.
- If applicable, create a unit test and add a visual test for Cypress.

## 📚 Example File Structure

```
packages/
└── mermaid/
    └── src/
        └── layout/
            └── myCustomLayout/
                ├── index.ts
                ├── utils.ts
                └── types.ts
```

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] All dependencies installed via `pnpm i`
- [ ] Layout folder and files created under `src/layout/`
- [ ] Entry registered in `registerDefaultLayoutLoaders`
- [ ] HTML test file added under `cypress/platform/`
- [ ] Diagram renders as expected at `localhost:9000`
- [ ] Code is linted and documented
