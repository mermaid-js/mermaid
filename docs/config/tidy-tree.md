# Tidy-tree Layout

The **tidy-tree** layout arranges nodes in a hierarchical, tree-like structure. It is especially useful for diagrams where parent-child relationships are important, such as mindmaps.

## Features

- Organizes nodes in a tidy, non-overlapping tree
- Ideal for mindmaps and hierarchical data
- Automatically adjusts spacing for readability

## Example Usage

```mermaid-example
---
config:
  layout: tidy-tree
---
mindmap
root((mindmap is a long thing))
  A
  B
  C
  D
```

```mermaid
---
config:
  layout: tidy-tree
---
mindmap
root((mindmap is a long thing))
  A
  B
  C
  D
```

```mermaid-example
---
config:
  layout: tidy-tree
---
mindmap
root((mindmap))

## Note

- Currently, tidy-tree is primarily supported for mindmap diagrams.
