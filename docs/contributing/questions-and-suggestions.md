# Questions or Suggestions?

**_\[TODO: This section is still a WIP. It still needs MAJOR revision.]_**

## First search to see if someone has already asked (and hopefully been answered) or suggested the same thing.

- [Search in Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mermaid-js/discussions)
- [Search in Issues (Open & Closed)](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues?q=is%3Aissue)

If you find an open issue or discussion thread that is similar to your question but isn't answered, you can let us know that you are also interested in it.
Use the GitHub reactions to add a thumbs-up to the issue or discussion thread.

This helps the team know the relative interest in something and helps them set priorities and assignments.

Feel free to add to the discussion on the issue or topic.

If you can't find anything that already addresses your question or suggestion, _open a new issue:_

Log in to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com), open or append to an issue [using the GitHub issue tracker of the mermaid-js repository](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Area%3A+Documentation%22).
