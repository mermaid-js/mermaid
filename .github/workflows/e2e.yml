# We use github cache to save snapshots between runs.
# For PRs and MergeQueues, the target commit is used, and for push events, github.event.previous is used.
# If a snapshot for a given Hash is not found, we checkout that commit, run the tests and cache the snapshots.
# These are then downloaded before running the E2E, providing the reference snapshots.
# If there are any errors, the diff image is uploaded to artifacts, and the user is notified.
