        ## Before you submit...
        First of all, thank you for proposing a new Diagram to us.
        We are always happy about new ideas to improve Mermaid.js wherever possible.

        To get the fastest and best response possible, make sure you do the following:

        - Use a clear and concise title
        - Fill out the text fields with as much detail as possible.
        - Never be shy to give us screenshots and/or code samples. It will help!

        ## Example issues

        Refer to the discussions here to get an idea of how the diagram syntax is created.

        Would you like to implement this yourself, or is it a proposal for the community?
        If there is no corresponding PR from your side after 30 days, the diagram will be open for everyone to implement.
      options:
        - I will try and implement it myself.
        - This is a proposal which I'd love to see built into mermaid by the wonderful community.
